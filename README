# Demonstrates the memory management primitive in modern C++ known as Smart Pointers.
# 
#
# Phase 1. Uses old C++ 98 style pointers to build a Trie Data Strucutre for a Simple but efficient String Search
# Phase 2. Use Modern C++ 2011/2014 to build a Trie Data Strucutre with memory mangement leveraging the smart pointer facility
# Phase 2. make a dslink primitive that uses this search.

This code base is an experimental API to demonstrate that Demonstrates the memory management 
primitive in modern C++ known as Smart Pointers. 

Projects Comparing Modern C++ to C++ 98
=======================================
The goal is to compare the memory management support in modern C++ versus the 
C++ 98 as a reference point.


1. Project "team-concepts" builds a C++ 98 project and implements a Trie data strucutre 
(which is a fancy name for a Tree used for String search ) which uses old-style raw pointers.

2. Project "team-concepts-modern" then implements the same Trie data strucutre 
using STL containers and Smart Pointers and uses a Modern C++ (2011/2014).

The APIs are implemented run using C++ 98, C++ 2014 runtime.

2. MEMORY LEAK DETECTION
=========================

Microsoft VC++ distribution supports a facility to check for memory leaks called CRT Debug Heap. 
The projects team-concepts and team-concepts-modern are instrumented to detect leaks.

This code base running on a windows platform naturally uses a Microsoft facility to check for 
memory leaks. For linux, we can take a platform dependent approach.

3. TESTING STRATEGIES
=========================
A Project "team-concepts-test" is created to run and track unit tests. 

Demonstrates the use of a mock test framework to test the above Library.

It uses google test framework. However, there are many other frameworks such as boost unit test framework 
that will work equally well.

4. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES
=========================
Deploying this code as a DSLink and as a game is the next phase of this project.

5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
=====================

Primarily due to self-imposed time limits, some parts sucha as Class and Function headers 
are not complete in this code base.
